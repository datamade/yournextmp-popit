<h3>{% trans "Find a Constituency ID" %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
In order to look up candidates for a constituency, you have
to find the ID of that constituency. The IDs that we use for
constituencies are the IDs for Westminster constituencies areas
in another web
service, <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org">MapIt</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h4>{% trans "... from a postcode" %}</h4>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
Suppose you want to find the constituency for the postcode
SW1A&nbsp;1AA, then you would make a GET request to the
following URL:
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA</a>
</pre>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
This <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">returns
a JSON object</a>, wherein the constituency ID can be found
at <tt>.shortcuts.WMC</tt>.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_postcode">postcode
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a>.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h4>{% trans "... from a latitude / longitude or other coordinate" %}</h4>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
You can look up constituencies in MapIt using a variety of
coordinate systems. To give the most common example, you might
have a WGS84 coordinate from a GPS or location API, in which can
you should put the SRID 4326 in your lookup. For example,
latitude 52.205083 and longitude 0.115194 could be looked up with:
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC</a>
</pre>

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
(Note that the longitude comes before the latitude, which might
not be what you expect.) The only key in that object is the
constituency ID.

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}

on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_point">point

<h4>{% trans "... by selecting it from its name" %}</h4>

{% blocktrans trimmed %}
If you need to produce a list of all constituencies (e.g. for a
select box) and allow the user to pick one, you can get a list
of all Westminster constituencies in the UK from this request:
{% endblocktrans %}

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC</a>
</pre>

<p>{% blocktrans trimmed %}
The <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">returned
data from that request</a> has the constituency ID as its keys;
the values are objects that include (among other things)
a <tt>name</tt> element that gives you the official name of the
constituency.
{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "Find Candidates for a Constituency" %}</h3>

<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    You can request all the candidates in that constituency by
    querying posts with the <tt>extra_slug</tt> filter
    parameter.  For example, for Dulwich and West Norwood, which
    has the ID <tt>65808</tt>, you would make the request:
    <a href="{{ base_api_url }}posts/?extra__slug=65808">{{ base_api_url }}posts/?extra__slug=65808</a>
  {% endblocktrans %}
</p>

<p>
  {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Each of the <tt>memberships</tt> in that reponse links to a
    person who is a candidate in that constituency for any known
    election.  The <tt>election</tt> property of each membership
    tells you which election that candidacy is for.
