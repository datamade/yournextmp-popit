    This is the simplest way to ensure that we can make this data as
    widely available as possible while preventing the hard work of
    contributors to {{ site_name }} being unfairly co-opted by
    companies building closed candidate databases. This also allows
    us the flexibility to release the data under different open licenses
    in the future.
